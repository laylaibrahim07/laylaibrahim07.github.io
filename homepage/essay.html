            Home Away From Home
          </h2>
          <p>
            New York City is more than just a concrete jungle to me. It is a place where cultures mix, dreams come alive, and communities are created. My parents, both immigrants, came here for different reasons. My dad’s parents brought him here from Egypt at the age of 12, with hopes of giving him a better life and more opportunities. My mom, originally from Australia, came here in her 20s from Hong Kong to experience the wonders this city offers. In 1996, fate brought them together at my dad’s restaurant, Casa La Femme.
          </p>
          <p>
            Casa La Femme (or casa, as my family calls it) is a unique place with a very vibrant atmosphere. From the moment you step through its doors, you're transported to a home in Egypt. It's not just a place to eat, it's an experience. The scent of traditional Middle Eastern dishes drifts from the kitchen, Egyptian music fills the air, and you're seated on cushions in a private tent, creating a comfy atmosphere. You're surrounded by other guests from diverse backgrounds all on a mini vacation to an exotic experience.
          </p>

            The sweet hibiscus tea you are greeted with begins your journey. The homemade mezzas of hummus, spicy feta, and babaganoush (pureed eggplant dip), served with freshly baked pita bread are a perfect start. I can’t count the number of times my family and I fought over the fluffiest piece of pita and dared each other to try the spicy harissa. Most guests order one of the charcoal-grilled kabob platters (chicken, shrimp, beef, falafel) with their choice of different rices (fattah rice, molokhia rice). The meal isn't complete without the crispy baklava drizzled with homemade honey syrup. Whenever my friends come over, they wait in anticipation the entire meal to eat it.
          </p>

            For me, Casa was even more than just a restaurant, it was a second home. From childhood birthday parties with themed decorations, to “playdates” with friends running around the back of the place and playing games in the kitchen, it has always been a place of joy. One particular memory I will always remember is on my 5th birthday when my parents turned the restaurant into a Peter Pan themed party where the belly dancers taught all my friends some moves.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was greatly enriched during my time at Casa through my interactions with different communities. I connected with my family as we would often have brunches or dinners together, celebrating something or simply spending time together. During covid, Casa allowed my family and I to even have a social distanced Thanksgiving. My time there with members of my church at fundraisers or events also offered me the luxury of understanding my culture. The feeling of family promoted by the restaurant wasn't just exclusive to my own family, but everyone who shared the cultural experience of eating there.

            Living in New York City, I am lucky enough to be exposed to people of all different backgrounds. Casa La Femme offered me an opportunity to interact with many different people in a relaxed and immersive environment. I spent a lot of time with the staff who I’ve become friends with. They are all of different ages and come from different parts of the world. I learned about their unique upbringings, dreams, and aspirations. Watching the staff work two jobs, while studying, to pay for their education gave me a better understanding of my dad’s experience growing up as an immigrant. Casa La Femme’s guests are also equally as diverse. Over the years, I met guests from all spectrums of life, from blue-collar workers to celebrities. Each group has had a significant impact on me as they’ve helped me become more confident when meeting someone for the first time, understanding each person I meet can offer me a valuable life lesson and perspective.

            As I was born in America, Casa helped me connect to my Egyptian roots. Often when I go inside Casa’s kitchen, I visualize my grandmother rolling grapeleaves and my Dad's aunt making Baklava at their house in Egypt. Like most guests, I was transported to Egypt upon entering its doors. From the food to the music I experienced, it gave me great pride to come from such a rich culture.

            Casa La Femme has been a landmark for the past 32 years. Now that I am older, I understand the sacrifices and amount of work my parents put into this place to make it so special. They were able to use their passion and ambition to create a truly unique place. Casa La Femme's success is evidence of the opportunities that New York City offers. It's a place where hard work can lead to great things. My parents built Casa La Femme as a dream. Today it lives on to teach and remind me of many values. The memories, community, diversity, and connection to my roots Casa offered are all the foundation of who I am today. The restaurant truly became my home away from home. In my 16 years of life, it has been a constant source of inspiration, learning, and joy. It's a testament to what makes New York City so unique and special.
